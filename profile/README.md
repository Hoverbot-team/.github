## Hi
Here you'll every piece of code needed for the Hoverbot robot and some tutorials(later). You'll also find the [Hoverbot SDK](https://github.com/Hoverbot-team/Software-Development-Kit) that will allow you to create software plugins or drivers for your own hardware extensions.
Desktop app or the code for the stationary transmitter for the robot is also availble.
